**Customer Churn Analysis**

**Overview**

This repository contains a project on Customer Churn Analysis, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The primary objective of the analysis is to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and to build predictive models to identify customers likely to churn.

Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

**Project Workflow**

Data Loading:

Load the customer churn dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize key trends and patterns.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features based on domain knowledge.

Model Building:

Train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

Evaluation:

Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment (Optional):

Export the best model for deployment.

**Results**

The analysis identifies key factors influencing customer churn and provides a predictive model with high accuracy and interpretability.
